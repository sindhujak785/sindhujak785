Hi, I’m @sindhujak785
I'm an Electrical Engineering graduate passionate about data-driven decision-making in energy systems and business operations.
With hands-on experience at NTPC and UPPCL, I blend power systems knowledge with tools like Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Python to solve real-world problems.
Currently sharpening my skills in data analytics and dashboard development to create impactful visual stories.
Open to collaborations on electrical, energy, or analytics-focused projects.
